Fela's words remain ever so poignant, 'Suffering and smiling'. That is who the average Nigerian is. It has become the nature of a people who, despite their many problems, still embrace their oppressors. We need to understand the way in which our country works before we can begin to change it. Change will not come, until we understand fully, the inner workings of our nation.",

It is a survival mechanism that we have developed out of our resilience, but it is also something we need to address. There should be a breaking point. We simply cannot continue like this. We just cant. For many years now, the situation of things within our borders has only gotten worse. Whichever way you choose to look, things are not working out. We all agree on this and say we want to change, but when it comes the time to exact that change, the same people who agreed with you will sing praises of their oppressors. Nigeria and Nigerians are two words that have frustrated many of us. That is why many find it difficult to even speak out against tyranny because, with just a little amount exchanging hands, loyalties are bought. The harsh truth is this; We may have played a part in deserving the leaders we have. In contributing to this vicious cycle that perpetuates ineffective governance. My question today is; Where lies our breaking point?",
